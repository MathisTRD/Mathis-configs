This is my own take on the classical Spotify look with a modern black&white color palette. It improves different visual parts of the default appearance and adds a lot more functionality, like better lyrics, a full app display, and the group listening feature on Desktop.

## Installation

**! You MUST install Spotify from the Spotify Web Page and NOT the Microsoft Store beforehand !**

Just run the ps1 intaller file and it should start installing all the extensions and restart Spotify automatically.
Otherwise, copy all the content of the ps1 installation file into a PowerShell window and hit ENTER.
